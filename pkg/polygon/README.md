# Polygon API Wrapper

- [Creating a Client](#creating-a-client)
- [Development](#development)
  - [Testing](#testing)

This package wraps the references defined by the [Polygon API](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/getting-started), and can be installed using

```
go get github.com/alpine-hodler/web
```

## Creating a Client

The `polygon.Client` type is a wrapper for the Go [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) standard library package.  An [`http.RoundTripper`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#RoundTripper) is required to authenticate for Polygon requests.  Currently the only method supported for Polygon authentication is via OAuth 2.0 bearer token.  See documentation examples for more information on best practices.

### Rate Limits

Per the [Polygon Knowledge Base](https://polygon.io/knowledge-base/article/what-is-the-request-limit-for-polygon-restful-apis):

> Our free tier subscriptions come with a limit of 5 API requests per minute. Paying customers are allowed unlimited API requests. While we do not have a concrete rate limit, we do monitor usage to ensure that no single user is affecting othersâ€™ quality of service. We recommend staying under 100 requests per second to avoid any throttling issues.

The HTTP package uses `"golang.org/x/time/rate"` to ensure that rate limits are honored.  This data is [lazy loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) to cut down on memory consumption.

## Development

Notes on developing in this package.

### Testing

You will need to create an account with [Polygon](https://polygon.io/pricing).  Then populate the following data in `pkg/polygon/.test.env`:
```.env
POLYGON_API_KEY=
```

Note that `pkg/coinbase/.test.env` is an ignored file and should not be commitable to the repository.
